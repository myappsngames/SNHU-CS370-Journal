# SNHU CS370: Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science
SNHU CS370 Project Two: Pirate Intelligent Agent

# Reflection


### 1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The Pirate Intelligent Agent project involved creating a reinforcement learning agent, specifically a Q-learning agent, to navigate a maze and reach a target. I was provided with a Python environment, including the TensorFlow and Keras libraries, along with a maze represented as an 8x8 matrix. The maze contained free cells, occupied cells, and a target cell. The agent's goal was to learn the optimal path to reach the target while maximizing its reward. While I was given significant portions of the code, including the environment, experience replay, model building, and game-playing functions, I was responsible for implementing the core Q-learning algorithm. This involved defining the logic for choosing actions based on exploration or exploitation, updating the Q-values based on agent experiences, and integrating the experience replay mechanism for improved learning. I also had to determine the optimal number of training epochs to achieve a 100% win rate.

### 2. Connect your learning throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
####  What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
####  How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
####  What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
