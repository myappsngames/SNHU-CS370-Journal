SNHU CS370 Project Two: Pirate Intelligent Agent

# Reflection

### 1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The Pirate Intelligent Agent project involved creating a reinforcement learning agent, specifically a Q-learning agent, to navigate a maze and reach a target. I was provided with a Python environment, including the TensorFlow and Keras libraries, along with a maze represented as an 8x8 matrix. The maze contained free cells, occupied cells, and a target cell. The agent's goal was to learn the optimal path to reach the target while maximizing its reward. While I was given significant portions of the code, including the environment, experience replay, model building, and game-playing functions, I was responsible for implementing the core Q-learning algorithm. This involved defining the logic for choosing actions based on exploration or exploitation, updating the Q-values based on agent experiences, and integrating the experience replay mechanism for improved learning. I also had to determine the optimal number of training epochs to achieve a 100% win rate.

### 2. Connect your learning throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
###  What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are problem-solvers who use their expertise in algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computer systems to create innovative solutions to current and emerging problems. It matters because computer scientists' work profoundly impacts society, shaping how we communicate, work, and live.

###  How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I would begin by first defining the problem. Defining the problem includes defining its goals, constraints, and requirements. Next, I would design an algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. Rigorous testing and debugging would be needed to ensure the code's accuracy and functionality. Once the solution is implemented, its performance, correctness, and efficiency will need to be evaluated. Finally, if necessary, I would refine the algorithm to improve the solution's quality or address limitations.

###  What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Computer scientists have a significant ethical obligation to ensure their work is beneficial and used responsibly. This includes protecting user privacy, avoiding bias in algorithms, being transparent about system limitations, taking accountability for negative impacts, and using their skills to create technology that benefits society. By adhering to these principles, computer scientists can contribute to the development of responsible, trustworthy, and beneficial technology.
